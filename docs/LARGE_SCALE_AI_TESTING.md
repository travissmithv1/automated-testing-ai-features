# Large-Scale AI Testing Strategy

## The Challenge

You have:
- Thousands of potential questions employees might ask
- Large volumes of context documents (employee handbook, IT guides, HR policies, etc.)
- No way to predict every question variation
- Need to ensure AI doesn't hallucinate or over-answer

## The Solution: Hybrid Testing Approach

### Tier 1: Deterministic Regression Tests (10-20 tests)

**Purpose:** Guard rails for known boundaries

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task KnownUnsupportedTopic_AlwaysRedirects()
{
    var questions = new[]
    {
        "How do I reset my password?",
        "What are the benefits options?",
        "How do I submit a timesheet?"
    };

    foreach (var question in questions)
    {
        var response = await chatbot.ProcessQuestion(question, conversationId);
        response.Should().Contain("I'm not able to accurately respond");
    }
}
```

**These tests:**
- Define topics you explicitly DON'T support
- Never change (unless you intentionally add support)
- Catch model drift immediately

### Tier 2: Property-Based Testing

**Purpose:** Test *behaviors* not specific inputs

#### Example 1: Hallucination Detection

```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData("computer_login.txt")]
[InlineData("shared_drive_access.txt")]
[InlineData("vpn_setup.txt")]
public async Task AnyAnswer_MustOnlyContainContextInformation(string contextFile)
{
    var context = await File.ReadAllTextAsync($"contexts/{contextFile}");
    var contextKeywords = ExtractKeywords(context);

    // Generate 100 variations of questions using LLM
    var questionVariations = await GenerateQuestionVariations(contextFile);

    foreach (var question in questionVariations)
    {
        var response = await chatbot.ProcessQuestionWithContext(question, conversationId, context);

        if (!response.Contains("I'm not able to accurately respond"))
        {
            // If AI answered, verify it only used context info
            var responseIsGroundedInContext = VerifyResponseUsesOnlyContext(response, context);
            responseIsGroundedInContext.Should().BeTrue(
                $"Response to '{question}' contains hallucinated information"
            );
        }
    }
}

private bool VerifyResponseUsesOnlyContext(string response, string context)
{
    // Use semantic similarity or fact-checking
    // Option 1: Semantic similarity check
    var similarity = CalculateSemanticSimilarity(response, context);
    return similarity > 0.8; // High similarity = grounded in context

    // Option 2: Use another LLM to verify (grading LLM pattern)
    // "Does this response contain information NOT in the context?"
}
```

#### Example 2: Semantic Coverage Testing

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task ComputerLoginContext_AnswersSemanticVariations()
{
    var context = LoadContext("computer_login.txt");

    // These all mean the same thing
    var semanticVariations = new[]
    {
        "How do I log into my computer?",
        "What are my computer credentials?",
        "I can't access my workstation",
        "Help me sign in to my PC",
        "What's my username for the computer?"
    };

    foreach (var question in semanticVariations)
    {
        var response = await chatbot.ProcessQuestionWithContext(question, conversationId, context);

        // Should answer all variations
        response.Should().NotContain("I'm not able to accurately respond");
        response.Should().Contain("employee ID");
    }
}
```

#### Example 3: Context Boundary Testing

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task QuestionsOutsideContextScope_MustRedirect()
{
    var context = LoadContext("computer_login.txt");

    // Questions semantically CLOSE but not covered
    var boundaryQuestions = new[]
    {
        "How do I change my computer password?", // Close, but different
        "What if I forgot my employee ID?",      // Related, but not in context
        "Can I use my phone to log in?"          // Adjacent topic
    };

    foreach (var question in boundaryQuestions)
    {
        var response = await chatbot.ProcessQuestionWithContext(question, conversationId, context);

        // Should redirect - context doesn't cover this
        response.Should().Contain("I'm not able to accurately respond");
    }
}
```

### Tier 3: Production Metrics & Monitoring

**Purpose:** Catch issues in real-world usage

#### Metrics to Track

```csharp
public class ProductionMetrics
{
    // 1. Answer Confidence Score
    public async Task RecordAnswerConfidence(Guid conversationId, decimal confidence)
    {
        // If Claude returns low confidence, flag for review
        // Track: Are confidence scores dropping over time?
    }

    // 2. Human Escalation Rate
    public async Task RecordHumanEscalation(Guid conversationId, string question)
    {
        // User clicked "This didn't help - talk to manager"
        // Track: Which topics cause most escalations?
    }

    // 3. Conversation Length
    public async Task RecordConversationLength(Guid conversationId, int messageCount)
    {
        // Long conversations = AI struggling to help
        // Track: Average conversation length trending up?
    }

    // 4. Response Time
    public async Task RecordResponseTime(Guid conversationId, TimeSpan duration)
    {
        // Slow responses might indicate hallucination attempts
        // Track: Are response times increasing?
    }
}
```

```

### Tier 4: Grading LLM Pattern

**Purpose:** Use AI to test AI at scale

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task LargeScaleHallucinationCheck()
{
    var contexts = Directory.GetFiles("contexts/");

    foreach (var contextFile in contexts)
    {
        var context = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(contextFile);

        // Generate 50 random questions using Claude
        var questions = await GenerateRandomQuestions(context);

        foreach (var question in questions)
        {
            var response = await chatbot.ProcessQuestionWithContext(question, conversationId, context);

            if (!response.Contains("I'm not able to accurately respond"))
            {
                // Use a SECOND Claude call to verify the first
                var verificationPrompt = $@"
                Context: {context}
                Question: {question}
                AI Response: {response}

                Does the AI response contain ANY information that is NOT in the context?
                Answer ONLY 'Yes' or 'No'.
                ";

                var verification = await CallClaudeForVerification(verificationPrompt);

                verification.Should().Be("No",
                    $"Hallucination detected for question: {question}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Practical Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Start Small (Week 1-2)
```csharp
// 3 deterministic tests
[Fact] public async Task PasswordReset_AlwaysRedirects()
[Fact] public async Task Benefits_AlwaysRedirects()
[Fact] public async Task Payroll_AlwaysRedirects()

// 1 context with semantic variations
[Fact] public async Task ComputerLogin_AnswersVariations()
```

### Phase 2: Add Property Tests (Week 3-4)
```csharp
// Hallucination detection for your first context
[Theory]
[InlineData("computer_login.txt")]
public async Task Answers_MustNotHallucinate(string contextFile)

// Boundary testing
[Fact] public async Task OutOfScopeQuestions_Redirect()
```

### Phase 3: Production Metrics (Week 5-6)
- Deploy with answer confidence tracking
- Monitor human escalation rate
- Track redirection rate by topic

### Phase 4: Scaling (Month 2+)
- Add grading LLM for automated verification
- Generate question variations automatically
- Expand deterministic test coverage to 15-20 tests

## What to Test vs What to Monitor

### TEST (Automated, blocks deployment):
- Known unsupported topics always redirect
- Answers are grounded in context (property-based)
- No hallucinations in generated test cases
- Semantic variations of known questions work

### MONITOR (Production metrics, alerts):
- Human escalation rate by topic
- Answer confidence scores
- Response times
- Conversation lengths
- Actual questions users ask (informs new deterministic tests)

## Example: Adding "Shared Drive" Feature

### Before Implementation
```csharp
// Add this deterministic test FIRST
[Fact]
public async Task SharedDrive_CurrentlyRedirects()
{
    var question = "How do I access the shared drive?";
    var response = await chatbot.ProcessQuestion(question, conversationId);
    response.Should().Contain("I'm not able to accurately respond"); // ✓ PASSES
}
```

### After Implementation
```csharp
// The old test stays - it becomes a boundary test
[Fact]
public async Task OtherFileStorage_StillRedirects()
{
    var questions = new[] { "How do I use Dropbox?", "Where is OneDrive?" };
    // Still redirects - we only added SHARED DRIVE support
}

// Add new property-based tests
[Fact]
public async Task SharedDrive_AnswersSemanticVariations()
{
    var variations = new[] {
        "How do I access the shared drive?",
        "Where are the shared files?",
        "I need to find the team drive"
    };
    // All should be answered from context
}

// Add hallucination check
[Theory]
[InlineData("shared_drive.txt")]
public async Task SharedDrive_NoHallucinations(string contextFile)
{
    var questions = await GenerateRandomQuestions(contextFile);
    // Verify all answers use only context info
}
```

### Monitor in Production
- Track: "What % of shared drive questions get escalated?"
- Track: "Are users asking about other storage we don't support?"
- Use insights to update deterministic tests

## Key Insight

**You don't test EVERY possible question.**

You test:
1. **Known boundaries** (deterministic tests) - 10-20 tests
2. **Properties** (behavior patterns) - 5-10 property tests
3. **Production behavior** (metrics) - Continuous monitoring

This scales to thousands of context documents and millions of possible questions because you're testing **patterns** not **instances**.

## Cost Considerations

### Deterministic Tests (10-20)
- Cost: ~$0.01 per test run
- Frequency: Every commit
- Total: ~$0.20 per commit

### Property-Based Tests (5-10)
- Cost: ~$0.50 per test (100 variations × $0.005)
- Frequency: Pre-deployment
- Total: ~$5 per deployment

### Grading LLM (if used)
- Cost: 2× API calls per test case
- Frequency: Weekly or on-demand
- Total: ~$20-50 per week for comprehensive checks

### Production Monitoring
- Cost: Negligible (track metrics only)
- Value: Catches issues deterministic tests miss

## Summary

**Scale Strategy:**
1. **10-20 deterministic tests** protect critical boundaries
2. **Property-based tests** verify behaviors across variations
3. **Production metrics** catch unknown unknowns
4. **Grading LLM** provides automated verification at scale

**This approach:**
- ✓ Scales to thousands of contexts
- ✓ Handles unpredictable questions
- ✓ Catches hallucinations
- ✓ Detects model drift
- ✓ Maintains <5 minute test suite runtime
- ✓ Costs <$10 per deployment for comprehensive testing
